Librarian focused on tech. You could call me a Technology Librarian.

About Me
======

I currently work at a public library where I help with technology related projects. I am taking the lead in our intranet renovation. I have contacted vendors, set up demos and proposed a migration tool for my library. 

My data journey started when I worked at a University where processed and cleaned student data. At the time, we were trying to use the data to see if we should seitch to a flipped classroom model in the Computer Science department. I created charts and infographics. This ended up becoming a published paper. 

I was also a math teacher where of course besides teaching and planning, we had countless meetings about student data. We used this data to better create lessons and assessments. 

I am a student at Eastern University working on a Masters in Data Science. As of this writing, my coursework is completed and I waiting on final grades and graduation. I wanted to have actual training snd education in data, as I was self taught for a while. I had a lot of sleepless nights and but here I am in the end! I even took a machine learning class. I wanted to challenge myself as I have never used machine learning before I started my program.
